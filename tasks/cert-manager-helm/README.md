# cert-manager
##### adds certificates and certificate issuers as resource types in Kubernetes clusters, and simplifies the process of obtaining, renewing and using those certificates.
##### It can issue certificates from a variety of supported sources, including Letâ€™s Encrypt, HashiCorp Vault, and Venafi as well as private PKI.

#### High level speaking, we will create Issuer (let's encrypt API) for handling Certificate request for our website, since we're using ingress controller, we will be updating the corresponding Ingress of the website with Issuer and issued Certificate from the issuer.  These are 2 stages of getting certificated - staging and prod, a real certificate can not be issued before staging one was successfully issued.

## Before we go.. make sure your load balancer is pointing to your ingress controller, and your application is deployed and resolvable by ingress controller.  Also it is publicly accessible.
```bash
curl http://nginx.example.com
curl -k https://nginx.example.com
```

## Install cert-manager
```bash
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
helm repo update
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.5.4/cert-manager.crds.yaml
helm install \
  cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
  --namespace cert-manager \
  --create-namespace \
  --version v1.5.4
```

## Create Issuer (let's encrypt) for staging and prod.  Change your@email.com to your email
```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-staging
  namespace: default
spec:
  acme:
    # The ACME server URL
    server: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    # Email address used for ACME registration
    email: your@email.com
    # Name of a secret used to store the ACME account private key
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-staging
    # Enable the HTTP-01 challenge provider
    solvers:
    # An empty 'selector' means that this solver matches all domains
    - selector: {}
      http01:
        ingress:
          class: nginx
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-prod
  namespace: default
spec:
  acme:
    # The ACME server URL
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    # Email address used for ACME registration
    email: your@email.com
    # Name of a secret used to store the ACME account private key
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-prod
    # Enable the HTTP-01 challenge provider
    solvers:
    # An empty 'selector' means that this solver matches all domains
    - selector: {}
      http01:
        ingress:
          class: nginx
```

## Verify Issuer status
```bash
kubectl describe issuer.cert-manager.io/letsencrypt-staging
kubectl describe issuer.cert-manager.io/letsencrypt-prod
```

### Expected output
```bash
Status:
  Acme:
    Last Registered Email:  your@email.com
    Uri:                    https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/acme/acct/29944978
  Conditions:
    Last Transition Time:  2021-10-13T11:53:45Z
    Message:               The ACME account was registered with the ACME server
    Observed Generation:   1
    Reason:                ACMEAccountRegistered
    Status:                True
    Type:                  Ready
Events:                    <none>
```

## Create Certificate for staging (This step will create a Certificate and Secret.  The Secret will later be used to update Ingress of the site
```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: nginx-example-com
  namespace: default
spec:
  secretName: nginx-example-com-tls-staging
  issuerRef:
    name: letsencrypt-staging
  commonName: nginx.example.com
  dnsNames:
  - nginx.example.com
```

### Verify Certificate status
```bash
kubectl describe certificate.cert-manager.io/nginx-example-com
```

### Expected output
```bash

## Update Certificate secret in Ingress for staging
```bash
kubectl get ingress
